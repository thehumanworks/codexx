//! Tracks when Codex-owned transcript scrollback must be repaired after terminal resize.
//!
//! Terminal scrollback is not a retained widget tree: once Codex writes wrapped lines into the
//! terminal, the terminal owns those rows. Width resize reflow treats the in-memory transcript cells
//! as the source of truth, clears Codex-owned history, and re-emits the cells at the current width.
//! Height-only growth also schedules a rebuild so rows exposed above the inline viewport are
//! restored from the same source of truth.
//!
//! This module owns only scheduling and stream-time repair state. It does not know how to render
//! cells or clear terminal output; `app::resize_reflow` consumes this state and performs the
//! rebuild. The key invariant is that a reflow request which happens while streaming output is
//! active, or while transient stream cells are still waiting for consolidation, must trigger one
//! final source-backed reflow after the stream becomes source-backed history.
