//! Orchestrates commit-tick drains for queue-backed plan streaming.
//!
//! This module bridges queue-based chunking policy (`chunking`) with the concrete stream
//! controller (`controller`). Callers provide the current controller and tick scope; the module
//! computes queue pressure, selects a drain plan, applies it, and returns emitted history cells.
//!
//! The module preserves ordering by draining only from controller queue heads. It does not schedule
//! ticks and it does not mutate UI state directly; callers remain responsible for animation events
//! and history insertion side effects.
//!
//! The main flow is:
//! [`run_commit_tick`] -> [`stream_queue_snapshot`] -> [`QueueSnapshot`] ->
//! [`resolve_chunking_plan`] -> [`ChunkingDecision`]/[`DrainPlan`] ->
//! [`apply_commit_tick_plan`] -> [`CommitTickOutput`].
